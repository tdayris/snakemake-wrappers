BiGR Pipelines
==============

BiGR pipelines are common pipelines used in the BiGR team. They are designed for Flamingo, and tested only on Flamingo.

For using them, simply follow instructions in each pipeline page.

The menu on the left (expand by clicking (+) if necessary), lists all available pipelines.
