HOMER GETDIFFERENTIALPEAKS
==========================

Detect differentially bound ChIP peaks between samples. For more information, please see the `documentation <http://homer.ucsd.edu/homer/ngs/mergePeaks.html>`_.


**URL**: http://homer.ucsd.edu/homer/ngs/mergePeaks.html

Example
-------

This wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    rule homer_getDifferentialPeaks:
        input:
            # peak/bed file to be tested
            peaks="{sample}.peaks.bed",
            # tagDirectory of first sample
            first="tagDir/{sample}",
            # tagDirectory of sample to compare
            second="tagDir/second"
        output:
            "{sample}_diffPeaks.txt"
        params:
            extra=""  # optional params, see homer manual
        log:
            "logs/diffPeaks/{sample}.log"
        wrapper:
            "0.50.4-2418-g8fefa1e53/bio/homer/getDifferentialPeaks"

Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.

When running with

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --use-conda

the software dependencies will be automatically deployed into an isolated environment before execution.
