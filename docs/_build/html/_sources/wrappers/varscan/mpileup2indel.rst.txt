VARSCAN MPILEUP2INDEL
=====================

Detect indel in NGS data from mpileup files with `VarScan <http://varscan.sourceforge.net/germline-calling.html>`_

**URL**: 

Example
-------

This wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    rule mpileup_to_vcf:
        input:
            "mpileup/{sample}.mpileup.gz"
        output:
            "vcf/{sample}.vcf"
        message:
            "Calling Indel with Varscan2"
        threads:  # Varscan does not take any threading information
            1     # However, mpileup might have to be unzipped.
                  # Keep threading value to one for unzipped mpileup input
                  # Set it to two for zipped mipileup files
        # optional specification of memory usage of the JVM that snakemake will respect with global
        # resource restrictions (https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/snakefiles/rules.html#resources)
        # and which can be used to request RAM during cluster job submission as `{resources.mem_mb}`:
        # https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/executing/cluster.html#job-properties
        resources:
            mem_mb=1024
        log:
            "logs/varscan_{sample}.log"
        wrapper:
            "0.50.4-2418-g8fefa1e53/bio/varscan/mpileup2indel"

Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.

When running with

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --use-conda

the software dependencies will be automatically deployed into an isolated environment before execution.

Software dependencies
---------------------

* ``varscan==2.4.3``
* ``snakemake-wrapper-utils==0.1.3``

Input/Output
------------
**Input:**

* A mpileup file

**Output:**

* A VCF file




Notes
-----

Varscan does not take any threading information by itself. However, mpileup
files given as input, might be gzipped.

If so, it's recommended to use two threads:

* 1 for varscan itself
* 1 for zcat
