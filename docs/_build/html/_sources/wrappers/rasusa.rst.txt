RASUSA
======

Randomly subsample sequencing reads to a specified coverage.

**URL**: https://github.com/mbhall88/rasusa

Example
-------

This wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    rule subsample:
        input:
            r1="{sample}.r1.fq",
            r2="{sample}.r2.fq",
        output:
            r1="{sample}.subsampled.r1.fq",
            r2="{sample}.subsampled.r2.fq",
        params:
            options="--seed 15",
            genome_size="3mb",  # required, unless `bases` is given
            coverage=20,  # required, unless `bases is given
            #bases="2gb"
        log:
            "logs/subsample/{sample}.log",
        wrapper:
            "0.79.0-2111-gcaef468e5/bio/rasusa"

Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.

When running with

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --use-conda

the software dependencies will be automatically deployed into an isolated environment before execution.

Software dependencies
---------------------

* ``rasusa=0.6``

Input/Output
------------
**Input:**

* Reads to subsample in FASTA/Q format. Input files can be named or unnamed.

**Output:**

* File paths to write subsampled reads to. If using paired-end data, make sure there are two output files in the same order as the input.



Params
------

* ``bases``: Explicitly set the number of bases required e.g., 4.3kb, 7Tb, 9000, 4.1MB |nl| If this option is given, ``coverage`` and ``genome_size`` are ignored


* ``coverage``: The desired coverage to sub-sample the reads to. |nl| If ``bases`` is not provided, this option and ``genome_size`` are required


* ``genome_size``: Genome size to calculate coverage with respect to. e.g., 4.3kb, 7Tb, 9000, 4.1MB |nl| Alternatively, a FASTA/Q index file can be provided and the genome size will be set to the sum of all reference sequences. |nl| If ``bases`` is not provided, this option and ``coverage`` are required


* ``options``: Any other options as listed in `the docs <https://github.com/mbhall88/rasusa#usage>`_.
