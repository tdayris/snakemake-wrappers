IRODS COPY
==========

This wrapper performs iRODS copy from a file url


Example
-------

This wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    rule test_iRODS_iget:
        output:
            "my_file.txt"
        params:
            input = "/irods/path/archive/my_file.txt"
        wrapper:
            "0.67.0-359-g027844ee/bio/iRODS/iget"


Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.
When running with

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --use-conda

the software dependencies will be automatically deployed into an isolated environment before execution.

    A script that handles iRODS copy.

    WARNING: Input file has to be defined in params, as it does not exists outside
    iRODS environment. Therefore, snakemake would raise a FileNotFoundError
    (false positive in best cases).

    snakemake.RemoteProvider.iRODS is not used since authentication cannot be
    securely transmitted within the wrapper.
