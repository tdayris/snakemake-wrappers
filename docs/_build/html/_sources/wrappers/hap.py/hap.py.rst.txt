HAP.PY
======

Comparison of vcf files and calculating performance metrics following GA4GH defined best practices for benchmarking small variant call sets

**URL**: https://github.com/Illumina/hap.py/

Example
-------

This wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    rule benchmark_variants:
        input:
            truth="truth.vcf",
            query="query.vcf",
            truth_regions="truth.bed",
            strats="stratifications.tsv",
            strat_dir="strats_dir",
            genome="genome.fasta",
            genome_index="genome.fasta.fai"
        output:
            multiext("results",".runinfo.json",".vcf.gz",".summary.csv",
                    ".extended.csv",".metrics.json.gz",".roc.all.csv.gz",
                    ".roc.Locations.INDEL.csv.gz",".roc.Locations.INDEL.PASS.csv.gz",
                    ".roc.Locations.SNP.csv.gz",".roc.tsv")
        params:
            engine="vcfeval",
            prefix=lambda wc, input, output: output[0].split('.')[0],
            ## parameters such as -L to left-align variants
            extra="--verbose"
        log: "happy.log"
        threads: 2
        wrapper: "0.79.0-1233-g75ee1b83d/bio/hap.py/hap.py"

Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.

When running with

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --use-conda

the software dependencies will be automatically deployed into an isolated environment before execution.

Software dependencies
---------------------

* ``hap.py==0.3.14``
* ``rtg-tools==3.10.1``

Input/Output
------------
**Input:**

* ``truth_regions``: Path to VCF containing high confidence variants
* ``strats``: Path to BED stratification file, see `official documentation on stratification <https://github.com/Illumina/hap.py/blob/master/doc/happy.md#stratification-via-bed-regions>`_ for more information.
* ``genome``: Path to reference genome
* ``query``: Path to the VCF that is to be compared and annotated.

**Output:**

* Multiple filtered files. See `the output file list <https://github.com/Illumina/hap.py/blob/master/doc/happy.md#full-list-of-output-columns>`_ on the official documentation.



Params
------

* ``extra``: Optional parameters

* ``engine``: One of ``xcmp`` (default), ``Rtgtools vcfeval``, ``scmp-distancebased``, or ``scmp-somatic``.
