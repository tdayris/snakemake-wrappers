This image shows quality control information about genes of interest.
It contains 4 graphs.

1. The normalized expression across conditions
2. The Âµ value, used by DESeq2 for its statistical test
3. The geometric mean expression of the given gene
4. The fold change of the given gene

If a gene is labelled "Non_Significative" it does not mean a gene expression does not change. It means that the observed change has a too high risk of being driven by something else than the considered factor.
